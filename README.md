# Recipe Book

## Description of Application
This React application allows users to save recipes to a MongoDB cloud database. It consists of a recipe entry form that uses React state variables to create and save recipes by entering a name, individual recipe ingredients, and directions for completing the recipe step-by-step, along with other information about the recipe. Each recipe can be given customizable tags to group and sort the recipes in future updates.

## Planned Features
In future updates I plan to incorporate additional ways to view and sort recipes. When completed, this application is intended to be used to create shopping lists containing the ingredients of saved recipes, so I plan on adding features to select recipes and add their ingredients to an easily accesisble list. Other potential features include recipe editing, search functionality, and login authentication.

## Technologies Used
React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React-Bootstrap CSS Framework, FontAwesome, React Router, Create React Express App Biolerplate, HTML, CSS, Javascript
